    <p><strong>Pad see ew (ผัดซีอิ๊ว)</strong> Thai fried noodle dish that's extremely popular as a quick street food meal in Thailand.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoon of cooking oil</li>
            <li>3 coloves garlic</li>
            <li>300 grams of wide flate rice noodles (in Thai they are known as 'sen yai')</li>
            <li>200 grams of your desired meat</li>
            <li>1 handful of chopped Chinese brocoli (kailan)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of dark sweet soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>black or white pepper for garnishing</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Comb through the fresh wide rice noodles, making sure any clumps are separated.</li>
            <li>Peel then mince 3 cloves of garlic, slice the chicken into small bite sized pieces, and slice the Chinese broccoli into 1.5 centimeter strips.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok (or frying pan) on a medium heat and add about 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
            <li>Wait until the oil is hot, and then fry the garlic for about 10 seconds or so, making sure it sizzles in the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped chicken to the wok and stir fry for it about a minute until the chicken is nearly all the way white in color and cooked pretty well though and through.</li>
            <li>Now, turn down your heat (or if you're using an electric stove you can even move your pan off the burner for a moment).</li>
            <li>Toss in the rice noodles, the Chinese broccoli, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and a ½ teaspoon of sugar.</li>
            <li>Still on low heat, start to fold the noodles gently by picking them up with the spatula from the bottom, and folding them over.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles for about 1 -2 minutes. If it gets a little dry, you can drizzle in a tiny bit of oil.</li>
            <li>After the noodles are well mixed, scoot the noodles to one side of the wok, and proceed to crack an egg into the empty side.</li>
            <li>Now it's time to crank up the heat on your stove - for the final step we want a little char on the noodles and egg for great flavor.</li>
            <li>Scramble the egg, and then fold the noodles onto the egg, sort of when it's half cooked. Let the heat sear the egg for a few seconds and then start folding the noodles and egg together. With a hot flaming fire, you should get a little char to both the noodles and the egg.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 30 more seconds, making sure to be gentle with the noodles, and then turn off the heat and dish it out.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little freshly ground pepper on the top of the noodles.</li>
