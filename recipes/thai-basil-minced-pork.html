    <p><strong>Thai basil minced pork (pad kra pao moo sub ผัดกะเพราหมูสับ)</strong> is a true classic. It's one of the most popular Thai street food dishes. 
        The minced pork is stir fried with Thai holy basil, and served on top of rice with a fried egg on the side.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>For the egg</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon of cooking oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>For Basil mince pork</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>200 grams of minced pork</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>4 Thai chillies</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of cooking oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of light soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of sugar</li>
                <li>1 handful of Thai holy basil leaves</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>First, fry the egg</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan on high-medium heat.</li>
                <li>When the oil is hot and sizzling, drop in the egg. Let it sizzle and bubble up, and at the same time, splash some of the hot oil onto the top of the egg.</li>
                <li>After the egg looks about right to your cooked likeness (I like mine runny), take it out, drain the excess oil, and put it on a plate for later.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Basil minced pork</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a mortar and pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife). They don't need to be super fine, you just want to bring out the oils and flavors from the garlic and chilies.</li>
                <li>Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems.</li>
                <li>Now it's time to start cooking. Heat your wok on high heat, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan.</li>
                <li>When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don't let them burn or get too dry.</li>
                <li>Toss in your minced pork. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you want to continue to stir and cook your minced pork until it's just about fully cooked all the way through. If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water.</li>
                <li>Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and finally a 1/2 teaspoon of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for about another 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the minced pork, and then immediately turn off the heat (if you're using an electric stove, you'll want to remove the pan from the burner). The holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the minced pork.</li>
            </ol>
