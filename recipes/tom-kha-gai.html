    <p><strong>Tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่)</strong> is one of the most famous Thai dishes.
        In Thailand, tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่) is eaten more like a curry instead of a soup, paired with a plate of rice and spooned onto your rice before eating it.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400 grams of chicken breasts</li>
            <li>6 cups coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 thumb chunk of galangal</li>
            <li>3 stalks of lemongrass</li>
            <li>1 big white onion (or 2 small white onions)</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 kaffir lime leaves</li>
            <li>200 grams of oyster mushrooms </li>
            <li>5 - 10 Thai chilies</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of lime juice</li>
            <li>small bunch of cilantro</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First take a thumb sized chunk of galangal, cut off the stems, and cut the root part into thin slices. It can be a little tough, so you might have to hit the top of your knife with your palm.</li>
            <li>Next grab your lemongrass, slice off the bottoms, pull off the outer skin layer, and then slice it diagonally into about 1 inch strips. This is just going to help release its amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Turn on your stove to medium heat, and add about 3 cups of the coconut milk to a medium sized saucepan. Put the pot on the heat and immediately toss in the sliced galangal and lemongrass.</li>
            <li>As your coconut milk begins to heat, move back over to your cutting board and slice up the chicken. Slice the chicken into medium sized chunks.</li>
            <li>Just before the coconut milk comes to a boil, add the chicken, and then add the other remaining 3 cups of coconut milk. Now, turn down the heat to a medium low, as you don't want the coconut milk to heat too fast or burn./li>
            <li>Prepare your Thai chilies by peeling off the stems and then just slice them diagonally. Go ahead and add them directly to the soup.</li>
            <li>Give the soup a quick stir, and then add about 200 grams of oyster mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Your coconut milk should not boil, but just maintain a nice low heat. Because coconut milk is so delicate, when you stir, be sure to move your spoon in 1 direction only, otherwise you run the risk of the coconut milk getting too shaken and it will start to curdle. Be gentle with the coconut milk.</li>
            <li>Move back over to your cutting board and peel and slice 2 small white onions into thick wedges (if your onion is really big, just use 1). Immediately toss the onions into the soup.</li>
            <li>Next, cut your tomatoes in the same way as your onions, into thick wedges. Wait until your tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่) is just about to boil, and then add the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Take the kaffir lime leaves, break them with your hand, and toss them directly into the soup. Breaking the kaffir lime leaves is going to release their flavor.</li>
            <li>Now add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to begin with (taste to add more)</li>
            <li>Mix your tom kha gai slowly and gently, for about 5 - 10 minutes, making sure it doesn't come to a full boil - and if it does - turn down the heat to even lower. You want the chicken, onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients to be fully cooked, but you don't want to overcook the coconut milk.</li>
            <li>After about 5 - 10 minutes of cooking, go ahead and turn off the heat completely.</li>
            <li>Go back to your cutting board, slice up a handful of fresh cilantro, and add it to the soup. Give it a quick stir, and the cilantro will cook enough from the already hot soup.</li>
            <li>The final step is to juice a couple of limes into a separate bowl and then add about 4 tablespoons of lime juice to the tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่). Again, just give it a quick and gentle stir, and it's ready to be served.</li>
